# Challenge-12

## Credit Risk

The purpose of this analysis was to use customer information to determine if a loan was healthy or unhealthy for a peer to peer lending company

Step 1: Import the lending data CSV 

Step 2: Create two variables X and y with the CSV data, with the binary data of loan status occupying variable y and everything in variable X

![X and y](https://github.com/seanpatel19/Challenge-12-/blob/913f31322885b6888bbb67f7357f194a2ae2831b/Images/X%20and%20y.jpg)

Step 3: Use the LinearRegression model from sklearn on the data 

Step 4: Add resampling data using RandomOverSampler 

Step 5: Create a Report explaining the findings and what model worked the best

## Usage

To use the data simply clone the repository.

Different sales values can be imput and the projections will change as well 

Charts could also be changed to make things look different
